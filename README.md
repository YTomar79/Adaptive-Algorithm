# Science Fair 2025

Hello there! If you are reading this, you most likely are judging my project (or someone trusted). I made this repository in hopes of giving you an even more in-depth snapshot of my project.

## Important Notes

1. The algorithm was trained in Qiskit's 1.2.4 version. However, the testing script uses the most recent Qiskit version to use `backend.refresh()`.
2. The **raw** test results are also included in my repository.
3. Model weights are included in the test file.

Note that I don't include the hyperparameters on my slideshow and posterboard. I did this to prevent anyone without access to this repository to prevent stealing my intellectual property as I was afraid that they would have enough information to replect the project on their own. Please note that YOU can view the hyperparameters in the agent.py file!

I tried to make things as self-explanatory as possible, but feel free to visit my booth if you have questions!
