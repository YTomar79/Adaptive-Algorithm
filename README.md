# Science Fair 2025

Hello there! If you are reading this, you most likely are judging my project (or someone trusted). I made this repository in hopes of giving you an even more in-depth snapshot of my project.



## Important Notes

1. The algorithm was trained in Qiskit's 1.2.4 version. However, the testing script uses a more recent of Qiskit (1.3.2) to allow use of `backend.refresh()`.
2. The **raw** test results are also included in my repository.
3. Model weights and policy are included in the test file.

## Hyperparameters

Note that I didn't include the agent's hyperparameters on my slideshow and posterboard. I did this to prevent anyone without access to this repository from stealing my intellectual property as I was afraid that they would have enough information to replicate my project on their own. 

**Please note that YOU can view the hyperparameters in the agent.py file!**

## Note to You All.

I tried to make things as self-explanatory as possible, but feel free to visit my booth if you have questions!
