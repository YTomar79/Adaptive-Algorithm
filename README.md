# Science Fair 2025

Hello there! If you are reading this, you most likely are judging my project.

## Important Notes

1. This code implementation was coded and trained in Qiskit's 1.2.4 version. However, the training script uses the most recent Qiskit version to use `backend.refresh()`.
2. Test results are also included in this repository for ease of access.

I tried to make things as self-explanatory as possible, but feel free to visit my booth if you have questions!
